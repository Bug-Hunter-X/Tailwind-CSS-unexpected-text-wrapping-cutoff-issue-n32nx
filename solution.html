  <p class="break-words">This paragraph now wraps correctly thanks to the addition of the `break-words` utility class. This class ensures that long words break correctly and prevents text cutoff.  Tailwind's `break-words` utility is often needed when dealing with unexpectedly long words or content that might not wrap naturally.  Check for conflicts with other classes, ensuring proper text wrapping.</p>
